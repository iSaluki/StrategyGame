# StrategyGame
A Godot based strategy game, made using UI elements

# What is this?

A little project I am working on in my spare time - development is infrequent and it may never be finished!

# Licensing

I do not own the licensing to all the graphical assets (KenneyNL can probably be credited for most), but the code is avaliable under MIT, although it is a bit spaghetti-like as this is more of an experiment than a production project.
